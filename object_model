Define a class and then instantiating it by using the .new method.

A module is a collection of behaviors that is useable in other classes via mixins. Modules are another way to achieve polymorphism in Ruby. We use them by mixing them into a class using the include reserved word

class MyClass
  include Hello
end

my_obj = MyClass.new

module Hello
  def hello (sayhello)
    puts "Hello!"
  end
end

say_hello = MyClass.new
